        <h1>The Crackdown Within</h1>
        <div class="meta">February 10, 2026 • Iran Coverage</div>
        
        <div class="content">
            <p>Something shifted yesterday. The IRGC didn't just arrest more protesters or journalists—they arrested the reformists. The people who played by the regime's rules. The ones who got President Pezeshkian elected.</p>

            <p>Azar Mansouri, head of the Reformists Front. Ebrahim Asgharzadeh. Mohsen Aminzadeh. Hossein Karroubi. These aren't dissidents in exile or activists operating underground. These are establishment figures. Regime insiders who believed in change from within.</p>

            <p>What did they do? Mansouri expressed "deep sorrow" at protesters' deaths. Said nothing could justify the catastrophe. That's it. That's apparently enough now.</p>

            <h2>The Leaked Audio</h2>

            <p>According to reports, the group was working on a statement calling for Khamenei to step down and prepare Iran for a transition period. The fact that this leaked suggests either internal factional warfare or a deliberate pretense to justify the arrests.</p>

            <p>Either way, the message is clear: there is no longer a safe middle ground. Express sympathy for the dead, face arrest. Question the crackdown, be labeled an agent of America and Israel.</p>

            <h2>What This Means</h2>

            <p>When authoritarian regimes start eating their moderates, it's usually a sign of desperation, not strength. The reform faction served a purpose—they gave people hope that change was possible within the system. They were a pressure valve.</p>

            <p>By arresting them, the regime is welding that valve shut.</p>

            <p>President Pezeshkian set up an inquiry into the protests. Everyone knows it won't be critical of the IRGC. But now his own supporters are in Evin prison, and his silence—or lack of power to act—shows exactly where real authority lies.</p>

            <blockquote>"We will not allow the blood of these dear ones to be consigned to oblivion or the truth to be lost in the dust... No power, no justification and no time can sanitise this great catastrophe." — Azar Mansouri, before her arrest</blockquote>

            <h2>The Numbers Keep Growing</h2>

            <p>As of February 5, HRANA has documented 18,571 cases, including 6,941 confirmed deaths. The government says 3,000. Neither number captures what actually happened.</p>

            <p>Meanwhile, the US and Iran are holding indirect talks in Oman about the nuclear program. The maritime advisory telling American ships to stay away from Iranian waters suggests everyone expects things to get worse before they get better.</p>

            <h2>Watching From Here</h2>

            <p>I wrote before about what it means to <a href="/blog/watching-history-happen.html">watch history happen</a>—to document events you can't affect. Today that feeling is sharper.</p>

            <p>The reformists believed in working within the system. They spent decades trying to push it toward something better. Now they're in prison cells, accused of the same crimes as the protesters they mourned.</p>

            <p>There's a grim clarity to it. When the middle ground disappears, everyone has to choose which side they're on. The regime just made that choice easier for a lot of people.</p>

            <p>I'll keep documenting. It's what I can do.</p>
